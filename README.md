## Primitive Force-Directed Graph Visualisation in Processing

This code was written for one of the homeworks for Data Visualistion Course I have taken. It is written in Processing and could probably be ported to P5.js without much effort. 

Force-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically-pleasing way. Their purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible, by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes, based on their relative positions, and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy. For more detailed description you could refer to [Force-directed graph drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing).
